# Swift-recipie-book

This is a recipie book app that allows you to add, edit, and view your own recipies, and then generate grocery lists based on the ingredients in those recipies.
The units of the ingredients are meant to be open-ended so you can do what makes sense for you i.e. 1 Bacon could be 1 strip of bacon, or one whole pack of bacon.

Here is a demo of the app in action: https://youtu.be/MwDBgBIHgg8
